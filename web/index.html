            Do you feel as though teaching your child more than one language can actually present disadvantages in their academic studies? 
            Some parents feel that teaching their child one language is sufficient enough and will help their child learn and focus more on the target language that is being taught in schools. Parents who speak another language other than english also feel that raising their children with more than one language will confuse their child and they will just end up mixing languages. There is subtantial amount of evidence that shows that learning and speaking more than one language is extremely beneficial to children and adults. Not only does it help with cognitive development but it is wanted and looked for globally. Children who are bilingual have a higher and better chance of getting high paying jobs in the future.

        <img src="img/wand.png" id="myth">
        <ul>
            <li><b>I'm too late! You have to start very early for second language learning or you will miss the boat</b></li> Although young children may seem to pick up language quickly, older children can also master second languages, all that matters is time and effort put into learning the language. 
            <li><b>Will my bilingual child mix up languages?</b></li> Mixing languages is temporary and goes away as the child's language vocabulary increases
            <li><b>Only native speakers and teachers can teach children second languages?</b></li> As long as children are getting exposure to the language and are interacting with adults, the child will be able to pick up the language and use it effectively. 
            <li> <b> Two languages are the most a very young child should be exposed to </b></li> The more the merrier, if the child has an opportunity to engage in meaningful interaction in each language on a daily basis, THEN GO FOR IT !
